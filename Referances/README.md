# References

## Overview

Searching the internet is nearly broken (it is an almost fruitless exercise of frustration), if you work at one of the search services, then it is time to do some earnest back propagating, and stop baking in so much chaos. At first, I kept track of reference pages, but when the search services got good I stopped, now I need to return to my old ways. 


## C language 

C is almost a subset of C++, but it takes less of my brain, so I have room for other things. It is counter-intuitive in areas and almost invites mistakes, none, the less C, has been a time tested workhorse.

The author of this C book is working on R-Pi's Desktop which is based on LXDE if I recall. I like that the R-Pi foundation is teaching C and Python. C is not gimmicky; it is like bedrock and is an excellent foundation.

The C Library provides a range of facilities and this manual documents them surprisingly well without distractions.
