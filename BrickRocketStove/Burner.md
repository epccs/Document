# Burner

## Overview

I am gathering information for a DIY gas burner, using propane or methane as fuel.

The burner will consist of a black iron gas pipe, a tee, and a few other items. 

```
air===1/2 npt=======L 
                    |
gas==3/8 nps=====>p<T====== burner==C
```

> < is a Brasscraft AU2-6-8S 3/8” OD flare x 1/2” MIP with 3/8” FIP tapped inside the MIP. 
p is a Brasscraft PPH-6 3/8” MIP that is manually drilled and tapped for a gas orifice nozzle to fit. 
L is a iron elbow with 1/2" FIP
T is a iron tee with 1/2" FIP
C is a iron cap with 1/2" FIP


# Notes

The nozel "p" needs drilled and tapped for a threaded brass orifice or "spud". These metering devices are found on many cooking stoves, I got mine when converting between LPG and natural gas. Other options for orifice fitting may be found at:

The metered gas and air need to mix in the tube after the tee and befor the burner outlets. 

The air intake needs to occur after the stove intake damper so that it does not result in a bypass, which can cause combustion inside the burner tube. The air-fuel mix should not be ignitable in the tube; it needs a little more air added to burn. Keeping the air-fuel mix in the happy range requires metering both the gas and the air mixed with it. When the stove/boiler pulls a draft, it needs to apply pressure to the intake damper rather than a poorly done bypass.

The burner is an iron pipe with small holes drilled to allow some of the air and fuel mixture into the stove where it becomes ignitable. The characteristic blue flame means that enough oxygen is present to consume the fuel completely; it also indicates healthier combustion byproducts but lacks breathable oxygen (e.g., do not vent it indoors).
