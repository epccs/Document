# Brick Rocket Stove

## Overview

It is made with red clay bricks (not fire brick but good enough) and adobe.  


## Previous Iterations

Adobe is not permanent, so that I can overhaul previous designs.

I am not going to cover the background.


## Planning

Some planning is done by setting bricks out. It helps get the ideas in my mind.

The propane burner is going to be under the intake slots; the burner will mix fresh air from the intake box so that I can restrict the net airflow into the stove by changing it into the intake box. 

The intake parts remained cool to the touch with the last stove, so I expect they will do so with this setup. I will pour a liquified adobe to the outside of the burner to hold it in place.
